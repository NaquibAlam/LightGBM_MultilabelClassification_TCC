# LightGBM_MultilabelClassification_TCC
1. It contains the code of how multilabel classification can be used with LightGBM or in general.
2. It also uses regex extensively for text cleaning. 
3. Kfold CV has also been used with multilabel classification which could also be extended for parameter tuning.
4. This code can be extended for other kind of models also which uses same approach for multilabel classification.
5. This approach of multilabel classification works properly when target classes are independent of each other.
6. Other ways of implementing multilabel classification such as, modeling dependence of classes or classifier chaining, is not discussed in this repo.
7. The data used in this repo can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data.
